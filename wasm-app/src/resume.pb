êWorked in a team to built parser and intepretor for a simple imperative language ¬µ in Java. It's similar to building a CPU instructions emulator, except that we get input as ASTs instead of instructions. We also did compiler optimisation such as unreachable code removal.JavaEhttps://gitfront.io/r/user-3433146/YogCP6vcEEWj/programming-language/Z†
