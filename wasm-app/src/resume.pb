¢Implemented an "adventure" style 2D game in the terminal, which supports a generic task (quest) system that allows developers to add new tasks to the game easily.Code in RustSerdeRON<https://gitfront.io/r/user-3433146/scjzw6WGSk71/adventurers/2√
ÈImplemented an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server in Rust, that spawns a new OS thread for each client connection, and maintains the shared data in the main thread. The implementation also supported a generic plugin (extension) system.Code in RustSerdeRON;https://gitfront.io/r/user-3433146/M34VKy3AJgjr/IRC-server/2ß
